To troubleshoot the VPN connection issue, follow these steps:

1. **Check Internet Connection:**
   - Ensure that the user's internet connection is active and stable. 

2. **Review VPN Credentials:**
   - Confirm that the user is entering the correct VPN username and password.

3. **Restart VPN Client:**
   - Instruct the user to close the VPN client completely and then reopen it.

4. **Check VPN Configuration Settings:**
   - Ensure the VPN server address and settings are correctly configured on the user's VPN client.

5. **Firewall/Antivirus Settings:**
   - Ask the user to check if their firewall or antivirus software is blocking the VPN connection. If so, they may need to whitelist the VPN application.

6. **Try a Different Network:**
   - Suggest trying to connect to the VPN using a different network (such as mobile data) to rule out any network-specific issues.

7. **Update VPN Client:**
   - Ensure that the VPN client software is up to date. If not, instruct the user to update it.

8. **Check for Service Outages:**
   - Verify if there are any known issues with the VPN service by checking the IT departmentâ€™s communication channels.
